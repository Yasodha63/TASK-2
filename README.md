# 🚢 Titanic Dataset Analysis – Task 02

This repository contains the code and outputs for **Task 02** of my internship, which involves deeper data visualization and exploratory analysis of the Titanic dataset. After performing data cleaning in Task 01, this task focuses on visual patterns and insights into survival factors.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Perform extended EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Visualize survival patterns by different features:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Age
  - Fare
  - Embarkation port
- Use graphs and charts to communicate insights

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- **Format:** CSV
- Contains info such as:
  - `Survived`
  - `Pclass`
  - `Sex`
  - `Age`
  - `SibSp`, `Parch`
  - `Fare`
  - `Embarked`

---

## 📊 Visualizations Used

- Count plot of survivors by **gender**
- Count plot of survivors by **passenger class**
- Histogram of **age distribution**
- Boxplot of **fare vs class**
- Pie chart of **embarkation ports**
- Heatmap for **correlation matrix**

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
